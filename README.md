# Sentimental-Analysis-Tool
The project aims to develop a sophisticated Sentiment Analysis and opinion-mining tool to analyze user reviews collected online. Using machine learning techniques, the tool will determine the sentiment expressed in the text like Amazon Reviews, Twitter, etc, and hopefully, Speech Recognition, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. The project focuses on leveraging real-world public datasets of user reviews to ensure the tool's applicability to diverse and authentic data.
